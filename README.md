Adidas is a German multinational corporation, that designs and manufactures shoes, clothing and accessories. It is the largest sportswear manufacturer in Europe, and the second largest in the world, after Nike. Adidas persuaded U.S. sprinter Jesse Owens to use his handmade spikes at the 1936 Summer Olympics. In 1949, following a breakdown in the relationship between the brothers, Adolf created Adidas and Rudolf established Puma, which became Adidas's business rival. The three stripes are Adidas's identity mark, having been used on the company's clothing and shoe designs as a marketing aid. 
The branding, which Adidas bought in 1952 from Finnish sports company Karhu Sports for the equivalent of â‚¬1,600 and two bottles of whiskey, became so successful that Dassler described Adidas as "The three stripes company".
